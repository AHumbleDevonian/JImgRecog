# JImgRecog
Java Image Processing with Image Recognition

This project is my own exploration into practical neural networks.

This is an ongoing project that will be continously developed and updated.


Phase 1 - Java Interface to upload 150x150 image, modify image and return for saving.

Phase 2 - Build Neural Network in Java.

Phase 3 - Test Neural Network with XOR problem.

Phase 4 - Recognise simple artifact in image.

Phase 5 - TBA

Phase 1 - Check
Phase 2 - Check
Phase 3 - Check
Phase 4
